Hello there! I'm Alex Cai. I'm a current Grade 12 student from the prairies of Western Canada and I'll be moving to Boston, MA to attend university in Fall 2021!

I haven't formally studied linguistics yet, but I plan to do so. I speak English and Mandarin natively and am proficient in French and German. I'm currently studying Japanese and Turkish, and eventually I hope to be able to understand at least one of the Semitic languages as well!

I'm also interested in computer science, math, music, fencing, and philosophy.

Feel free to get in touch via email at *alexandercai [at] outlook [dot] com!* I'm open to suggestions, criticism, and funny jokes.
