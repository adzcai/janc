## What is this place?

This is a small personal blog where I'll post about linguistics, worldbuilding, and conlanging, or language construction! I'm by no means a professional, and this is my first time attempting to create a language, so it's also a personal tool for me to document my progress and hopefully make a ton of productive mistakes.


## Why conlanging?

When you're learning math, you're expected to solve math problems to get better at the underlying concepts. When you verify scientific theorems, you recreate the original experiments to better understand where the results come from. If you're studying linguistics, or any language at all, why not do the same and attempt to create your own language to try and better understand how it works?

Okay, okay, of course, they're quite separate fields which are better suited to different methods of learning. But attempting to create your own language can be a lot of fun too, whether it's a wacky jokelang or a naturalistic artlang for a fictional species. I personally find language fascinating because of how fundamental it is to humanity, and how each language is a slightly different way of looking at the world.

Personally, one reason I'm doing this is famously encapsulated by the master of fictional languages himself:

!["Well, it is meant to be escapist. 'Cause I use escapism as its proper sense, of as... a man getting out of prison." — J.R.R. Tolkien](/media/tolkien-quote.jpeg)

Also, did I mention it's a lot of fun?


## How often will you post?

I'll try to write up at least 4 posts a month. Notice I didn't say one per week, because chances are my schedule will be chaotic and I have other priorities, but it'll generally end up being somewhere along those lines. I'll do my best to keep this blog going alongside my studies and eventually use it to talk about interesting discoveries in my research as well!

## Disclaimer

I recognize that content in fantasy worldbuilding and fiction in general can be seen as problematic, especially regarding issues such as racism and sexism. However, with the goal of making a realistic fictional world, I won't shy away from including gritty aspects, since they reflect a part of our flawed humanity and I don't think ignoring these issues is the way to tackle them in real life.

Also, this is fiction, and any correlation with real names or places is entirely coincidental. The content here is not meant to reflect my political views and I will do my best to post potential trigger warnings. If you disagree with my content, feel free to shoot me an email explaining why it's problematic or simply click away. Hope you enjoy!
