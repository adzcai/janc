So I have a few things in mind regarding the phonetic inventory for this conlang. Like I said in my first post, I'd love to go super crazy with it, but I think sometimes, including when putting together a list of sounds, less is more.

So I was looking at the phonetic inventories of a couple natural languages, and I really like the phonetic inventory of Japanese. It's super symmetric, only 5 monophthongs (so simple!), and I personally just <em>love</em> the bilabial fricative (i.e. the "f" [ɸ] sound in 布団 ("futon")).
