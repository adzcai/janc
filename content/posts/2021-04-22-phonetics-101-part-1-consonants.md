Alright, so I think I have a decent idea of how the next few posts are going to go. Since I hope this blog can be a resource for other amateur conlangers, I'll try and go through an introduction to the linguistic topic before diving into the actual conlanging. In this post, we'll start off with an intro to how consonants work, walk through the IPA chart, and build a phonemic inventory! By the end of this, you'll be an expert on the average human food hole and hopefully be able to decipher strange words like "voiceless palato-alveolar fricative". Let's dive in!

Most of this article is based on *The Sounds of the World's Languages* by Ladefoged and Maddieson, a super comprehensive text I've recently started and would highly recommend for an in-depth investigation of phonetics.

## What is phonetics?

So language can be communicated in a number of different ways, such as writing, signing, or, most importantly, speaking. When we speak, we move our mouths (and bits further back) and push air through (most of the time) to make sounds. **[Phonetics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Phonetics)** is simply the study of how we make these sounds, including how we can analyze and classify them! (Not to be confused with **phonology,** the study of how these sounds are actually organized into a language.)

We call the smallest unit of sound a **phone** (or more generally a **segment**), such as the consonant "p" in "pot". (Not to be confused with a **phoneme**, a sound which could change one word to another.) To represent these sounds, we use the International Phonetic Alphabet.

<details>
<summary>Why not just use the English alphabet?</summary>
<p>
First of all, there's a lot of sounds that English simply <em>doesn't have,</em> like retroflex or epiglottal consonants. 

Also, English is actually an <em>extraordinarily</em> awful language when it comes to spelling, simply because our words come from so many different other languages (Latin, French, German, Norse, to name a few) so we never really had a consistent spelling system to begin with. The fact that spelling bees even <em>exist</em> attests to that! (Many places don't have them because the spelling is actually consistent — you know, like it should be.)

The main issue is that there's not a one-to-one mapping between sounds and letters. Heck, even our vowels (a, e, i, o, u) aren't even pure vowels, they're <em>diphthongs</em>, except for "e" ([eɪ], [i], [aɪ], [oʊ], [ju])! In total, English and its various dialects actually has around <em><strong>25 vowel sounds</strong></em>[^1] (12 monophthongs, 8 diphthongs, and 5 triphthongs (like the British "hour" [aʊə])), which is a sheer absolute monstrosity. Japanese only has 5 monophthongs! Beautiful!

The IPA fixes this by having distinct symbols for all sounds which humans can use to distinguish between words (i.e. phonemes, see below),[^2] put together into a [chart](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/International_Phonetic_Alphabet_chart#/media/File:IPA_chart_2020.svg). You can find a [clickable one here](https://www.ipachart.com/). Most of the Latin alphabet symbols are pronounced the same way they are in English.

<summary>Phones vs phonemes</summary>
<p>
For example, say the words "pun" and "spun", and pay attention to the "p" sound in both of them. Sound identical, right? They actually aren't! Put your hand in front of your mouth and try it again. You should feel a puff of air when you say "pun", but nothing (or very little) when you say the "p" in "spun".

The difference between the aspirated \[pʰ] and the unaspirated \[p] makes no difference in English; you can swap them without changing the word. Therefore, we would consider both of them the same phoneme, /p/. On the other hand, this *would* make a difference in languages such as Chinese, Icelandic, or Hindustani. For example, in Mandarin Chinese, "爸" \[pa] (father) and "怕" \[pʰa] (fear) are different words, and /p/ and /pʰ/ would therefore be considered different phonemes.
</p>

<details>
<summary>But the inside of the mouth is continuous. How can we categorize sounds into distinct categories?
</summary>
<p>
To answer this, let's consider two languages A and B. Let's say each of them have three distinct vowels that go from high to low (aka "close" to "open") in the mouth: language A has A1, A2, A3, and language B has B1, B2, B3.

If we get a language A speaker and a language B speaker together, and we find out that A2 is equivalent to B1, and A3 is equivalent to B2, then there must be at least four different vowels:

<table>
<tbody>
<tr>
<td>1</td>
<td>A1</td>
<td></td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>2</td>
<td>A2</td>
<td>B1</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>3</td>
<td>A3</td>
<td>B2</td>
</tr>
<tr>
<td>4</td>
<td></td>
<td>B3</td>
</tr>
</tbody>
</table>

As we encounter more and more languages, we can begin to get a good sense of which sounds humans can distinguish.

Consonants like \[x], \[k], \[c], and \[d] are formed by three main properties:

1. Place of articulation
2. Manner of articulation
3. Voicing

## Places of articulation

Let's start off with a cross-section of the average human oral cavity!

![a cross-section of the human oral cavity](/media/mouth.jpeg "a cross-section of the human oral cavity")

Firstly — the tongue is *huge,* isn't it!?

Let's start with consonants, which are made when you block off air from the lungs.

Anyways, in the above picture, you'll see a lot of things that can move, and a lot of places they can go. We call the thing that moves the **active articulator**, and the place it goes the **articulatory target region** (sometimes called the **passive articulator**). Together, they form a **place of articulation** that determines where a consonant is made.

### Active articulators

There's 5 main active articulators, each with a specific name for sounds that use them (I use the terms "articulation" and "gesture" interchangeably):

1. The lips, which are involved in **labial** gestures.
2. The tip and blade of the tongue, which make **coronal** articulations.

   * Motions with the tip are called **apical,** marked with a " ̺", as in \[t̺]
   * Motions with the underside of the tip: **sub-apical**
   * Motions with the blade (the part slightly behind the tip): **laminal,** marked with a " ̻", as in \[t̻]
3. The body of the tongue, which is involved in **dorsal** gestures.
4. The root of the tongue and the epiglottis, which make **radical** articulations.
5. The glottis, which makes **glottal** articulations.

![a diagram with labels indicating the lower lip, the tip and blade of the tongue, the body of the tongue, the root of the tongue, and the glottis](/media/screen-shot-2021-04-22-at-2.07.23-pm.png "sagittal section of the vocal tract")

### Passive articulators

There's about nine regions that can be considered as target areas of articulation:

* the lips (labial)
* the teeth (dental)

  * marked with a " ̪" under the consonant, e.g. \[t̪]
* the alveolar ridge, that gummy ledge behind your upper teeth, (alveolar[^1])
* the sloped part behind it (post-alveolar), the hard palate (palatal)
* the soft palate, aka velum (velar)
* the uvula (uvular)
* the pharynx, the part of your throat behind the mouth (pharyngeal)
* the epiglottis, the flap that makes food go down the right tube (epiglottal)

There's also the glottis, the opening behind your vocal folds (glottal). These nine-plus-one regions are shown in the figure in the following section

### Places of articulation

By combining an active articulator and the target region, we end up with around 17 possible combinations where articulators can be brought together, which about 12 of which are commonly seen:

\*\* More precisely, "denti-alveolar" describes sounds where the tip of the tongue is against the teeth and the blade is pressed flat against the alveolar ridge.
</summary>
If you're confused by this, don't worry — I was too, and it looks like these sounds are very similar. In her 1991 Ph. D. thesis, \\\[Articulatory and Acoustic Properties of Apical and Laminal Articulations](https://escholarship.org/uc/item/52f5v2x2), Sarah Dart did research showing how native speakers of e.g. English and French use these and their apical alveolar equivalents more or less interchangeably.
</details>

These places of articulation are shown in the three diagrams below:

![a diagram with labels showing the labial, dental, alveolar, post-alveolar, palatal, velar, uvular, pharyngeal, epiglottal, and glottal regions of articulation](/media/screen-shot-2021-04-22-at-2.19.27-pm.png "a cross-section of the vocal tract showing the target of articulation")

![two diagrams showing cross-section of front of mouth](/media/screen-shot-2021-04-22-at-4.00.56-pm.png "cross-section of the front of the mouth")

There's a few other terms you might hear when talking about place of articulation. **Alveolo-palatal** (aka **alveopalatal**) consonants, such as <x> in the Mandarin pinyin system, take place with the blade of the tongue against the alveolar ridge and the body of the tongue 

Great! Hopefully after staring at this gobbledegook for long enough and making strange noises with your mouth for longer than you'd like to admit — ahem — you should have a good sense of the different places in the mouth where consonants are made and more or less what they sound like. Now it's time to move on to the next section of what makes a consonant: **manner of articulation.**

## Manner of articulation

While place of articulation tells you where in the mouth a sound is made, **manner of articulation** tells you how much the air is obstructed. Roughly in order from totally obstructed to almost free-flowing, the manners of articulation listed on the 2020 IPA are:

1. Plosive

   * Stop air entirely, and then quickly released in a small puff of air
   * e.g. \[p], \[b], \[t], \[d], \[k], \[g]
2. Nasal

   * Air is rerouted through the nasal cavity
   * e.g. \[m], \[n], \[ŋ]
3. Trill

   * An articulator is held in place, and air blown past it causes it to vibrate back and forth
   * e.g. French \[ʀ] or Spanish \[r] or bilabial \[ʙ] like blowing a raspberry or playing a brass instrument
4. Tap or flap

   * An articulator is thrown against another in a single gesture
   * E.g. the middle consonant in the American pronunciation of "latter" \[læɾə˞]
   * The Japanese "r/l" sound is typically also an apical alveolar tap
5. Fricative

   * Air is almost fully obstructed, creating a hissing sound (aka "turbulent airflow")
   * \[f], \[v], \[θ], \[ð], \[s], \[z], \[ʃ], \[ʒ], \[x], \[h]
6. Lateral fricative

   * An l-like sound where the tongue blocks the airflow through the middle of the mouth and air is pushed through the sides to create a hissing noise
   * \[ɬ], found in Icelandic, Welsh, and Navajo
7. Approximant

   * No hissing sound; airflow only slightly impeded
   * \[ɹ], \[j], \[w]
8. Lateral approximant

   * "l-like" sounds when the tongue obstructs the airflow through the middle of the mouth and redirects it through the sides
   * \[l]

Alright! Now all that's left is the simplest aspect of consonants: voicing.

### Voicing

Voicing is simply whether or not your vocal chords are vibrating. For example, hold your throat (not too hard please) and say "fan" and "van". You shouldn't feel anything when making the \[f] sound, but you should feel buzzing as you pronounce \[v]. That's how you can tell that \[f] is unvoiced, while \[v] is voiced!

And that's it! Now you have everything you need to understand the consonant section of the IPA. Here it is!

Hopefully that means now you can figure out the voiceless palato-alveolar fricative!

  Note that I didn't say "all sounds producible by humans", since there's also sounds like what you might find in beatboxing or licking your lips that don't feature at all in human language.

[^3]:
  Note that "alveolar" only denotes the *front* part of the alveolar ridge, i.e. the flat part right behind your teeth. The sloped part behind the ridge is the post-alveolar region.
