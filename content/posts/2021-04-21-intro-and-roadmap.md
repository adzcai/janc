# Introduction and Roadmap 

So here it is! Our first-ever article. Here I want to set a basic framework and some goals for my first ever conlang, which I'll refer to as \<CONLANG> until I come up with a name for it[^1] later down the road.

## Roadmap

Based on most sources I've seen, putting together a language can be grouped into a few main steps:

* Phonology
  * Phonetic system
  * Phonotactics
* Writing system
  * Orthography
* Morphology
  * Derivational morphology
* Syntax
* Lexicon
  * Semantic fields
* Pragmatics

This isn't necessarily in order, and I'll probably come back to revisit, for example, certain parts of the morphology as I'm working on the syntax, and add words as I think about pragmatics. But this should serve as a decent general roadmap for what I'm hoping to accomplish.

## Types of conlang

So there are many different types of conlang, which you can read about in [The Art of Language Invention, Episode 1: Conlang Types](https://youtu.be/Mxmc8zo5Jns?list=PLyfe6tMeBf5W_O3YDqDnk4gqlMODILPpe).

\<CONLANG> is going to be a naturalistic fictional language, meaning that it should be plausible for my (humanoid) fictional species to naturally develop. That means, don't expect it to be entirely consistent! I'll shake things up with irregular verbs and things like that when it makes sense.

## Goals

My goals for my first ever conlang are:

1. **It should seem as realistic as possible.** This includes being at a reasonable level of difficulty and not being entirely regular. I should be able to look at it and say, hey, that's something that this intelligent fictional species could definitely have naturally developed.
2. **It should be understandable and pronounceable by humans.** I mean, what's the point of a language if we can't speak it, right?
3. **It should synergize with its speakers.** For example, see how Inuktitut has several different words for different types of snow. I hope to include things like idioms and cultural proverbs as I flesh out the speakers of the language through my worldbuilding. Since I'm trying to make my fantasy species distinct from human ethnicity as well, this means that I don't want to make my language simply an amalgamation of natlangs either.

My personal end goal, and the point of this blog, is to create an understandable grammar for this conlang, a decent-sized lexicon (aka vocabulary) and hopefully integrate it one way or another into my worldbuilding as well.

Here we go! My first step is to get started on the phonology by put together a phonetic inventory — a list of all the sounds the language is going to have. See you in the next post!

[^1] the coolest name I've ever heard for a script is \[Devanagari](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Devanagari), used across the Indian subcontinent for languages such as Hindi, Marathi, Sanskrit, etc, which roughly means "from the abode of divinity". How epic is that!?
